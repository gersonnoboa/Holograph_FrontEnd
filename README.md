# Holograph Front-End
This tool was done as a part of my Master's thesis for the University of Tartu. It is a resource impact analysis tool, that shows the data generated by the back-end implementation of Holograph, which can be found [here](https://github.com/gersonnoboa/Holograph_BackEnd]).

Holograph Front-End is a front-facing application developed in Angular to evaluate the veracity and usefulness of the proposed method for evaluating resource impact in an event log. The site works closely with Holograph Back-End. The app can be divided into three parts: file upload, parameter generation, and results. 

In order to deploy, do the following steps (Windows only):

1. Clone the repository
2. Install npm on your machine.
3. Install angular/cli.
4. Navigate to the repository folder and execute ng serve.
